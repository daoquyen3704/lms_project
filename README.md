**LMS Project** (Learning Management System)

## Introduction

This project is a Learning Management System (LMS) composed of a **backend** and **frontend** part. It is intended to provide a platform for managing courses, users (students, instructors), content, and other typical LMS features.

The codebase uses technologies such as:

* PHP + Laravel (or a PHP framework) on the backend
* ReactJS on the frontend
* SCSS for styling

Languages used: JavaScript, PHP, SCSS ([GitHub][1])

## Installation

Here’s a general guide. Adjust as needed for your environment.

### Prerequisites

* PHP (version compatible with your framework)
* Composer
* Node.js + npm / yarn
* A database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
* Web server (Apache, Nginx) or built‑in server

### Steps

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daoquyen3704/lms_project.git
   cd lms_project
   ```

2. Setup backend

   ```bash
   cd backend
   composer install
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env to set database credentials, app URL, etc.
   php artisan key:generate
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed   # if seeders exist
   ```

3. Setup frontend

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install    # or yarn
   npm run dev    # or yarn dev / build
   ```

4. Start the application

   * Depending on setup, you may run `php artisan serve` for backend and serve frontend via bundler or integrate into one server setup
   * Access via browser (e.g. `http://localhost:8000`)

## Project Structure / Folder Layout

From the root:

```
/
|-- backend
|-- frontend
```

* `backend`: contains the server-side code (probably Laravel + PHP)
* `frontend`: contains client-side code (JS, CSS, build scripts)

You may also find subfolders like `routes`, `controllers`, `views`, `assets`, etc.

## Features

Some likely or planned features (you should verify or adjust):

* User authentication & authorization (student, instructor, admin)
* Course creation, enrollment, management
* Content upload (lessons, files, videos)
* Quizzes / assessments
* Progress tracking
* Role-based dashboards
* Responsive UI

---

## Usage / How to Run

Once installed and configured:

* Visit the app in your browser
* Register / login
* For instructors: create course, upload lessons
* For students: browse courses, enroll, view content
* Admin: manage users, courses

You can add more detailed usage examples (e.g. API endpoints, sample commands) here.

## Configuration

* `.env` variables (database, mail, storage, app URL)
* Frontend config (API base URL, build targets)
* .htaccess or web server configs

---

## Dependencies

* Backend: PHP, Laravel (or similar), relevant PHP packages
* Frontend: JS framework / libraries (Vue, React, or plain), SCSS, build tools
* Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL
